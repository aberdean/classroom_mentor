## Classroom Mentor

- The role of a classroom mentor is to answer your questions regarding the courses that you are taking. We enjoy answering questions, so feel free to post your questions in the mentor chat window.

- When you post a question or comment, you can expect a reply within 24 hours (i.e. communication isn't *Live*, classroom mentorship is not a *chat service*).

- So any technical questions that you have will have to be posed in a way that is clear, so that I can answer them directly (i.e. if I need clarification on any parts of your question then they will be difficult to answer, and will lead to a frustrating time lag for you).

  - Include a link to the quiz, where relevant.
  - Include any code, where relevant.

- Classroom mentors do not review projects before submission (We can clarify questions that you have about the requirements or review comments but we can't pre-review projects). Once you are happy that you have met the requirements (laid out in the project Rubric), then you are ready to submit your project.

## Posting Code in the Chat Window:

- On **separate** lines, **before** and **after** your code, you put three **backticks**  (which are beside 1 on a QWERTY keyboard  <kbd>  ` </kbd> <kbd>  1 </kbd> </kbd> <kbd>  2 </kbd>  ) - which looks like (*See the footnote for other keyboard layouts* <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>):

- To move to a new line, in the chat window, use `Shift + Enter` at the same time.

- **Note**: Any spaces on the lines with _`'backticks'`_ will produce very odd formatting.

- For example:

    ![alt text][image_1]

- That is, the individual steps are:

  1. Type three backticks.

  2. Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> at the same time (to move to a new line).

  3. Copy and paste your code directly into the window.

  4. Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> at the same time (to move to a new line).

  5. Type three backticks.

## Posting Code on an External Site:

You can post your code at http://pastebin.com/ - **No Login is required**

1. Go to http://pastebin.com/

2. Copy and paste your code into the window in *`pastebin`*

3. Select the appropriate syntax highlighting (type the first few letters of the language).

4. Click *`Create New Paste`* and copy the **URL** and **post that URL in the chat window**
